        ".The silhouette scores provide insights into the clustering and embedding performance. DBSCAN demonstrates the highest silhouette score, indicating dense, well-separated clusters, suitable for varying density data with noise. K-means yields a low silhouette score, suggesting less distinct clusters or suboptimal partitioning. Hierarchical clustering performs marginally better than K-means but falls short compared to DBSCAN, implying reasonable cluster separations. Word2Vec and BERT embeddings both surpass K-means and hierarchical clustering, with BERT slightly outperforming Word2Vec. This implies that both deep learning-based embedding methods capture more nuanced semantic information, potentially leading to more meaningful data representations conducive to clustering tasks, albeit with varying degrees of improvement.\n",
